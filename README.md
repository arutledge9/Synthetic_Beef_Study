# bacteria_beef

## Summary

I've been helping my friend, Roza, compile data from a study of volunteers where Roza's team collected samples of the volunteers' belly button bacteria in the hopes of discovering the perfect bacteria to use in creating synthetic beef. Her team collected not only the types and counts of bacteria, but also demographic information of the test subjects, as well as how frequently the subjects washed their belly buttons. I helped Roza put all of this data on a website, where each test subject's data is available (anonymously) via a drop down menu, where a visitor can select the subject's user ID, then have their data display in a number of visually pleasing and informative formats.
